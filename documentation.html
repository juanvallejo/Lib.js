				<p><span class="libjs">Lib.js</span> requires the use of an HTML5 canvas element for animations. <a href="#Compatibility">Read more about it here.</a></p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def2">Below are shown some steps that must be taken to ensure things go smoothly:</p>
				<pre>
				&lt;!--Link the library to your HTML document.--&gt;
				&lt;head&gt;
				  &lt;script src = "path/to/Lib.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
				  &lt;script&gt;
				    window.onload = function() {
				      //any of the code in this guide goes in here...
				    }
				  &lt;/script&gt;
				&lt;/head&gt;
				&lt;!--once that's done, make sure you place your code inside of a 'window.onload' function, or at the end of your document. This is essential as your canvas element must be loaded before it can beused by the library.--&gt;
				</pre>
				<p class="def2">Throughout this guide, we're going to assume that all code given will be wrapped inside of a <samp>window.onload</samp> function.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>First thing's first. Before we begin animating anything, the canvas element must be created and set up to be used with the <samp>Lib()</samp> object. We do this by typing the code below:</p>
				<pre>
				var canvas_element = document.getElementById("my_canvas"); //get html canvas element
				Lib().setCanvas(canvas_element);
				</pre>
				<p class="def">FYI: The <span class="libjs">Lib.js</span> folder comes with sample sprite images in the 'Graphics' folder for us to use throughout this guide.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>That's all there's to it. We can now begin creating our objects and <samp>Lib()</samp> will place them in the canvas for us.</p>

				Lib().sprite("PATH/TO/IMAGE",[128,128]);
				</pre>
				<p>Above is a sample sprite object that shows a very basic way to use the API to create a sprite animation.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def">Sprite objects are objects that are individually animated using a sprite sheet. The sprite sheet contains different copies of an image, each with a distinct change, either side-by-side or top-to-bottom. Each of these image copies will be referred to as a "frame" and are shown one at a time in a certain order in order to emulate the animation of an object.</p>
				<p></p>
				<pre>
				"PATH/TO/IMAGE" //This parameter specifies the location of a sprite image in your device.
				[128,128]  //This array specifies the width and height of each "frame" in your sprite image
				</pre>
			</div><!--.doc-box-->
			<div class="doc-box-subtitle" id="Complex API Structure">Complex API Structure</div><!--.subtitle-->
			<div class="doc-box">
				<pre>
				Lib().sprite({
				  src:'PATH/TO/IMAGE',  //our image source
				  size:[128,128],    //array that specifies [width,height] of each frame in our image
				  position:[0,0],    //This method tells the library where to begin reading our image
				  frequency:16,    //This method tells the library how fast to animate our image
				  speed:70,    //This method is used in more complex animations.
				        //Besides frequency, each object may also possess its own speed.

				  x:'center',    //the x coordinate where each frame of our sprite will be placed
				  y:200      //the y coordinate where each frame of our sprite will be placed
				});
				</pre>
				<p>Above is a sample sprite object that shows a more flexible way of creating a sprite object.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def">In the above example we passed all of the settings we wanted to apply to our object as a single argument in the form of a JSON object. This format should be familiar if you use or have used jQuery in previous projects.</p>

				<pre>
				Lib().setCanvas(canvas_element);
				</pre>
				<p>Above is an aforementioned example on how to set a canvas with Lib.js.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def">When <samp>.setCanvas()</samp> is used, the canvas element is immediately assigned a tab-index; this means that when working with keyboard events later on, the element must be focused in order to catch these events. This also gives you more flexibility with your animations, as you can make an animation's runtime dependent on it.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def">Lib.js supports multiple canvases. This may seem relevant in situations where you might need simultaneous animations in different parts of your document.</p>
			</div><!--.doc-box-->
			<div class="doc-box-subtitle" id="Sprite Objects">The Sprite Object</div><!--.subtitle-->
			<div class="doc-box">
				<p>Lib.js allows for the creation of two types of objects; Sprite and Non-sprite. We will create a Sprite object below:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib("sample_object").sprite("PATH/TO/SPRITE",[120,120]);
				</pre>
				<p class="def">We have just created a sprite object using short syntax. This method of creating an object takes individual parameters as settings rather than one parameter as a JSON object. Each possible parameter is explained below:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib("sample_object").sprite("PATH/TO/SPRITE",[120,120],16,[0,0],'horizontal',[0,1,2,3]);

				"PATH/TO/SPRITE"  //the source to the image sprite.
				[120,120]    //the size of each frame.
				16      //How fast our sprite's frames will be cycled.
				[0,0]      //The x and y coordinates we want our sprite to be in.
				'horizontal'    //the direction we want our image to be read. 'horizontal' or 'vertical'
				[0,1,2,3]    //the frames of our sprite we want to cycle through, and their order.
				</pre>
				<p>Let's take a look at a more flexible approach at creating the same object; this time, with more options:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib("sample_object").sprite({
				  id:'sample_object',  //our object's id
				  src:'PATH/TO/IMAGE',  //our image source*
				  size:[128,128],    //our image size [width,height]*
				  position:[0,0],    //the position to start reading our sprite image
				  frequency:16,    //the speed at which to read the sprite image
				  frames:[0,1,2,3,2,1]  //amount of frames to cycle through, and their order.
				  speed:70,    //the speed of our object (at which it'll move accross x and y)
				  reverse:true,    //reverses the current frame order
				  x:'center',    //x coordinate of the object; takes 'center', 'top', 'right',
				        //'left', 'bottom' or a number for values
				  y:200      //y coordinate of the object; takes 'center', 'top', 'right',
				        //'left', 'bottom' or a number for values
				});
				* required values
				</pre>
				<p>Each object's sprite image will be individually loaded, making each sprite object available to be interacted with at differing times. This will be discussed further in the next section.</p>
			</div><!--.doc-box-->		
			<div class="doc-box-subtitle" id="Image Objects">The Image Object</div><!--.subtitle-->
			<div class="doc-box">
				<p>An image object is pretty much a sprite object with a single frame. Therefore, the syntax for both may appear similar. Below is a basic form of the API for creating a static image object:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib("static_image").image("PATH/TO/IMAGE",100,200);  //args: source, x-pos, y-pos
				</pre>
				<p class="def">Since the library doesn't have to worry about animating our image, its syntax becomes much simpler, there are however options to customize it further:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib("static_image").image({
				  src:"PATH/TO/IMAGE",  //our image source
				  size:[100,200],    //the size of our image [width,height].
				  speed:200,    //how fast our image is translated accross the canvas
				  position:[0,0],    //used to display a specific region of our image
				  x:100,      //image's x pos. 'left' 'right' 'bottom' 'center' or a number
				  y:'bottom'    //image's y pos. 'left' 'right' 'bottom' 'center' or a number
				});
				</pre>
				<p class="def">The image's width and height are automatically calculated. Although the image size array is not needed because of this, we may still use it if we wish to shrink or enlarge our image object.</p>

			<div class="doc-box">
				<p style="font-size:0.9em;color:rgb(173,205,210);">Due to its focus on simple animation, Lib.js handles image loading in real-time (no preloading); this means that to interact with a sprite object after it's been created, you must do so inside of a <samp>.load()</samp> event. This will be discussed further in this section.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Notice how in the last section, we added a parameter to the main function like so:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib("sample_object") //once loaded, this will return the sprite object from above
				</pre>
				<p class="def">By adding this parameter, we are assigning an id of <b>sample_object</b> to our object. This is very important as whatever name we decide to give our object is going to be how we reference it in the future.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Now that we know how to assign an id to objects, lets see how referencing these objects is done:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib("sample_object").load(function() {
				  //this code will be executed once this object has finished loading
				});
				</pre>
				<p class="def">One way to interact with existing objects is by placing code inside of a <samp>.load()</samp> callback function for that object.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def">A more effective way of interacting an object, specially when there is more than one is to attach a <samp>.load()</samp> callback functon to the main <samp>Lib()</samp> object, like so:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib().load(function() {
				  //code here will execute when every sprite object in the canvas has been loaded.
				});
				</pre>
				<p>By using the latter method, we can call and interact with any object in the canvas, without the need to attach individual <samp>.load()</samp> methods to each object.</p>
				<pre>
				Lib().load(function() {
				  Lib("sample_object").getX(); //returns the x coordinate value for this object
				});
				</pre>
				<p class="def">The reason why this must be done in order to access our objects is because their images must be loaded before they can be placed in the canvas. Once the loading is done, we can call each object how you would expect them to be called.</p>

				<p>Aside from creating sprites and static images, <span class="libjs">Lib.js</span> allows us to draw basic canvas elements as well. Below is the basic syntax for drawing a line:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib("sample_line").line(0,0,200,100,"red");

				0  //first arg: starting x position
				0  //second arg: starting y position
				200  //ending x position
				100  //ending y position
				"red"  //color of line

				<p>To have a few more options, there is always the more flexible syntax:</p>

				  y:0,      //starting y position

			<div class="doc-box">
				<p>To begin, let's start by going over the two most important methods of controlling a sprite object's animation.</p>
				<p class="def">Let's assume we are still working with our <b>sample_object</b> from earlier on.
				<pre>
				Lib("sample_object").stopAnimation(); //stops animating that individual object's sprite
				</pre>
				<p><samp>.stopAnimation()</samp> is a method available at both the sprite-object level, and the global API level.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def">As we have seen in the example above, calling this method on a particular object, will cause only that object to freeze its sprite animation. Note that this method does not freeze that object to its x and y coordinates, it simply stops animating its sprite. The object can still be translated accross the canvas.</p>
				<p class="def"></p>
				<p></p>
				<p>To call <samp>.stopAnimation()</samp> at the global level, simply follow the example below:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib().stopAnimation(); //stops animating every sprite on the canvas
				</pre>
				<p>By not specifying an object's id, we call the main Lib object and tell it to stop animating every sprite currently on the canvas.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def">This is useful specially for situations where you have only one sprite object being animated while having the rest remaining static. Combinging these animation methods with input rules will allow for more precise animation, specially in games, and will be discussed in the next chapter of this guide.</p>
			</div><!--.doc-box-->
			<div class="doc-box-subtitle" id="Manipulating Frames">Manipulating Frames</div><!--.subtitle-->
			<div class="doc-box">
				<p><span class="libjs">Lib.js</span> allows us to have complete control of a sprite object. This involves, of course, setting the amount of frames you wish to render, the order of these frames, and their size.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def">Each object has methods for getting and changing their x and y coordinates at any given moment (after they have been loaded into the canvas), as well as methods for altering sprite animation settings, provided the object is a sprite object. The methods each object contains are <a href="#APIs">given and explained here</a>.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def">The <span class="libjs">Lib.js</span> folder comes with several sample images for us to use. Refer to the 'Graphics' folder for these.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>In the examples below, we create a loading animation sprite that will play frames at differing combinations.</p>
				<pre>
				Lib("loader").sprite("graphics/loader.png",[128,128]);
				//because we only entered the two required parameters, every other setting will be set
				//to its default value. The number of possible frames will be automatically calculated.
				//all available frames for this object will be rendered, and they will cycle from left to right.

				Lib("loader").sprite({
				  src:'graphics/loader.png',  //required value
				  size:[128,128],      //required value
				  direction:'vertical'    //default is 'horizontal'
				});
				//this object will be rendered exactly as the last one, except its sprite image will be read vertically, and its frames will cycle from top to bottom. This is not very effective with the particular sprite image we're currently using, as it is drawn to be read from left to right.
				</pre>
				<p class="def">Now that we have learned about the purpose of the <b>direction</b> property, let's try controlling the frames themselves:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib("loader").sprite({
				  src:'graphics/loader.png',
				  size:[128,128],    //notice the size entered is the width and height of each frame,
				        //and not of the entire sprite image. (pixels).
				  frames:[0,1,2,3,4],  //takes an array of integers. We don't want its highest number
				        //to exceed the total amount of frames our sprite image has.
				  frequency:20,    //default value is 16. Frequency is how fast the library will
				        //cycle through our frames.
				  position:[0,0]    //the location (in our sprite image) in which the library will
				        //begin reading the frames.
				});
				//the object above will animate just fine at a frequency of 1.3 times the default value. Instead of cycling through all of its frames, the object will cycle up to the fifth frame (starting with the frame located at 0 pixels in the x direction of the sprite image).

				//Once the fifth frame is cycled through, the animation will be reset to the first frame.
				</pre>
				<p class="def">To find out the amount of frames your sprite image has, simply count the number of images drawn on it from left-to-right, or top-to-bottom depending on the image.</p>
				<pre>
				Lib("loader").sprite({
				  size:[128,128],
				  frames:[0,1,2,3,4,3,2,1],
				  frequency:15,  //notice the frequency has been changed, making this animation slower
				  position:[0,0],
				  reverse:true  //will cause frames to cycle in reverse
				});
				//Aside from changing its frequency, we also changed the object's frame order. This time, it will cycle to frame four, and cycle down to the first frame available. Since the 'reverse' is set to <samp>true</samp>, our animation will cycle through the frames backwards.
				</pre>
				<p class="def2">Here is what our <b>loader</b> object looks like when animated with default settings. (If you see nothing below, try upgrading your browser).</p>

			<div class="doc-box">
				<p>By translating an object, we are simply moving it accross the canvas. Here is where the <b>speed</b> property of each object comes into play.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>To begin, simply create any type of object from the ones we have discussed throughout this guide, then, we'll use the object API in order to integrate its movement with the current frame rate of the animation.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def2">You can read more about each object's API <a href="APIs">in this section of the guide</a>.</p>
				<p></p>

				var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas_id"); //we're starting from scratch

				Lib().setCanvas(canvas); //can't forget the canvas
				Lib("my_object").sprite("my_image.png",[100,100]); //Here we create the object and name it "my_object"

				//now we tell Lib.js to execute the rest of our code once all of our objects are loaded. This allows us to be able to call any object without any issues
				Lib().load(function() {
				  Lib("my_object").increaseX();  //here we use the .increaseX() API method in order to
				          //move the object to the right indefinitely

				<p>Input rules are a simple way of centralizing keyboard event actions. They allow easy integration of keyboard event handling with the frame rate of an animation, and flexibility with object manipulation.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def">Input rules are added directly to the <samp>Lib()</samp> object and are applied to any of the objects selected. Below is an example of an input rule callback function added to the main object:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib().addInputRule(function() {
				  //The Input API is placed here to be executed alongside the rest of the animation
				});
				</pre>
				<p class="def">The object input API will be discussed in detail in the next section. Its methods MUST be placed inside of an <samp>.addInputRule()</samp> callback function as shown above in order to be executed. This not only helps keep code organized, for efficiency, but also allows flexibility when catching keyboard inputs.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def">Below we see another example demonstrating the use of the <samp>.addInputRule()</samp> method, as well as showcasing some of the object input API:</p>
				<pre>
				Lib("my_object").sprite("image.png",[120,120]); //creating the object
				//telling Lib to execute the following code after all objects have been loaded
				Lib().load(function() {
				  Lib().addInputRule(function() {
				    var object = Lib("my_object"); //for simplicity, we'll assign our object to a var
				    //.hasInputKey() only takes key codes as input for now
				    if(Lib().hasInputKey(37)) {
				      object.decreaseX();
				    }  
				  });
				});
				</pre>
				<p class="def">In the example above, we add a <samp>.addInputRule()</samp> block and assign <b>my_object</b> to a variable. We then use <samp>.hasInputKey()</samp> to move our object to the left (decreasing y direction) if <samp>Lib</samp> detects the left arrow key pressed (key code of 37).</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def">Please note that the <samp>.addInputRule()</samp> method <b>must</b> be placed inside of a <samp>.load()</samp> callback method, as shown in the example above.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p class="def2">Please note that you can add as many input rules as needed. The demos page contains an example demonstrating the example above further. <a href="index.html">You can visit the demos page here</a>.</p>
