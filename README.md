Lib.js
======
Lib.js is a library for facilitating HTML5 animations.

Read the "documentation.html" file for an entire breakdown of the API.

View the "index.html" file for sample animations with working code you can copy / paste and tweak yourself to learn more about each part of the syntax.

the "graphics" folder contains free sprite and non-sprite images you can use to further expand projects.
